    If you don't add 30 seconds then you're always truncating with an

    Since it's only a single minute and since a person is just as likely
    to gain a minute as lose a minute, this is unbiased.
    The law of large numbers (of samples) starts to kick in around 25 samples for a normal distribution.
    One week of clocking in and out is 5*2*2 = 20 (including break or lunch) so by the time it's been two
    weeks the math says we're now unbiased.
